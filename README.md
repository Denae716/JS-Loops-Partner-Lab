# JS Loops Partner Lab

## Description
You will pair program with a partner to complete this assignemnt. One partner, the driver, should share their screen and be the one typing. The other partner, the observer, should review each line of code. Both partners should be cooperating when solving problems. When an objective has been met, the driver should push the code to the GitHub account, the observer should pull the changes, and the two partners switch roles.

2. Ask the user for 10 numbers and display the largest number that they entered
3. Write a program that determines if a number is prime or not

## Part Three
1. Every January 1st you deposit $100 into your bank account. Your bank provides you a whopping 1% interest on your account! After 10 years, how much is in your account if you started with $0.
